[2] The purpose of my game is the user controlling the ball and attempting to score a goal. 
    In order for the player to score a goal the player must roll the ball into the goal itself. 
    However, there is a goalie in the game and he oscillates between the two goal posts.
    The goalies acceleration slowly increases, so as the player be careful and try not to take too much time.
    There is a score board, the goalie hopes to reach 5 saves before the player can achieve 5 goals. 
[3] In order to play the game the player uses the arrow keys to control the movement of the ball.
[4] In this project I used a lot of the lessons taught by the roll a ball tutorial.
    As well as familiarize myself with the Unity program itself.
[5] My own contributions to this game was the entire graphics of the scene. 
    I created the structures, and also wrote up the code to create the movement.    
[6] From this assignment I learned how to use the Unity software, and familiraize myself with the basic structures and concepts.
    I also learned more about coding in C#. Before this assignment I had no experience with it. 
    I feel more comfortable with it but know I still have all to learn about it.
